## Course Description

Learn best practices and advanced concepts related to development within an enterprise environment during this intensive, sixteen-week course. Students are expected to participate in lectures, discussions, lab exercises, major team and individual projects, and independent study projects and presentations.  Students should expect to spend an average of 6-8 hours per week outside of class on this course. Note these time ranges are approximate and are dependent upon reading speed, typing speed, processing time, and other individual factors.

### Prerequisites

* Grade of C or better in Advanced Java Programming, 10152112

### Materials

* There is no formal textbook for this course. We will use a variety of online resources.
* The use of GitHub is required for the course. All students must create a GitHub account and keep all course work in GitHub.
* An external USB 3.0 hard drive is required for the use of the Virtual Machine if you are not using your
own laptop in class. 

### Class Software

All software for this course is available at no cost.

* IntelliJ IDEA will be the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of choice for this class. All class examples and demonstrations will use this IDE. Students, however, are free to use any editor that is compatible with the project standards and expectations.
* Tomee+ (pronounced "Tommy Plus") is the Java Enterprise Edition of Apache Tomcat (Tomcat + Java EE = TomEE).
* MySQL
* Git and GitHub
* JDK 1.7 and JDK 1.8
* Openshift's free tier will be used for deployment and hosting of our applications on the web.

## Course Flow

### Weekly Preparation

Each week of the course will focus on one or more topics. Students are expected to read/watch the assigned references for that week's topic/s prior to class.  

### Lecture/Demo/Discussion/Activities 

Class time will include lecture/demo and discussion of the week's topic/s. All code resulting from class demos will be available in GitHub. There may be additional activities included in class to help learn new concepts.

### Weekly Exercises

All weekly exercises will be listed within the weekly repositories. These exercises will provide you with in-class practice working with each new technology/topic in an isolated environment. The product of each exercise will be a working example of that week's technology/topic. If exercises are not completed in class, they must be completed before the next week's class. 

Completed exercises will be "turned in" using a git pull request. This will be demonstrated and practiced in class.  Here's the workflow:

1. Fork the repository for the exercise.
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
1. Review the readme for instructions.
1. Modify/add files to complete your solution.
1. Make sure all of your code is committed.
1. Push/sync up to GitHub.
1. Create a pull request on the original repository. All exercises are due at the start of the following class, unless otherwise specified.
1. You can continue to push fixes and improvements – just add a comment in the pull request to let me know it's been updated.
1. Feedback will be given in the pull request, so please respond with your thoughts and questions! You are welcome to open the pull request as the work is still in-progress if you are stuck and want to ask a question. 

### Weekly Project Work

After completing the weekly exercises, you will implement the new technology/topic in your individual project. This provides the opportunity to immediately put new learning to the test by utilizing the technology in a real world application.  Implementation of each topic should be completed, committed and pushed to GitHub within two weeks of the topic's introduction/presentation. 

### Weekly Journals 

Students will regularly (minimum of once per week), document their work and progress in a journal. A template/example will be provided.

## Extracurriculars

Extracurricular activities are included to encourage students to explore IT opportunities and experiences outside of the classroom. Students will share their experience and learnings with their peers through a presentation about each activity s/he completes. Refer to [Extracurriculars](https://github.com/MadJavaEntSpring2016/Extracurriculars) for more detail. 

## Individual Project

The Individual Enterprise Java Project is designed to facilitate a student’s transition from Madison College to an industry career though the development of a high-quality software product. The project will encourage students to think critically and solve challenging problems while developing skills critical to a successful career in Information Technology. Upon completion, this project will be an important part of the student’s portfolio to be shared with potential employers.  Refer to [Individual Project](https://github.com/MadJavaEntSpring2016/IndividualProject) for more details.

## Team Project 

The Team Enterprise Java Project is designed to simulate a real world project in which team members contribute to a single software product. The product must be a significant web service or reusable library that could be used in the Individual Projects for this course. This means the consumers of the service or library will include developers outside of the project team. Upon completion, this project will be an important part of the student’s portfolio to be shared with potential employers.  Refer to [Team Project](https://github.com/MadJavaEntSpring2016/TeamProject) for more details.

## Class Participation 

I would like your help creating a classroom community that is open to sharing ideas, questioning, and creative collaboration. You can help meet this goal by:
* Actively contributing to both small and large group discussions and activities. 
* Providing thoughtful, timely feedback in peer code reviews and presentations.
* Providing assistance to classmates when needed.
* Asking for and accepting help from peers when you are stuck.

Attendance is the responsibility of the student. Refer to the college catalog for “rule of attendance”. As an adult you may have other priorities than this class, but you need to keep focus on the projects not to fall behind. Your instructor is not responsible for withdrawing you from the course. If you choose to withdraw from the course, you must go to your [myMadisonCollege](https://mymadisoncollege.swcportal.org/psp/pamatc/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=PAPP_GUEST) account and withdraw. You may be dropped from the course if you do not attend for two consecutive weeks or miss 25 percent or more of the total scheduled calendar days. No student will be re-admitted. 


## ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)

If you believe that you may require special accommodations or services in order to participate in this course, please contact [Disability Resource Services](http://madisoncollege.edu/disability-resource-services-drs) to receive an accommodation plan. You must provide this plan to your instructor to receive accommodations.


## College Catalog and Student Handbook

Many important MATC policies and procedures are found in the MATC College Catalog, available from the Student Services Office. Students are expected to be familiar with such policies and procedures, and are encouraged to retain a copy of the Handbook for reference as needed during their attendance at MATC.


## Madison College Counseling Service

The Madison College Counseling Service is available to provide aid and advice. Experienced counselors will try to help or put you in touch with others who can. This is a free service for all students. Learn more [here](http://madisoncollege.edu/times-and-locations).

## Statements on Academic Integrity

### Madison College

> Madison Area Technical College places a high value on the learning experience. As members of the college community, you are obligated to conduct your work with honesty and integrity. Please take time to review our [Academic Integrity Policy](http://madisoncollege.edu/academic-integrity).

### Instructor

As software developers, it is common and encouraged to consult with peers (and internet sources) for help debugging and problem solving.  However, such consultations should not involve direct copying of other's code. In cases in which a student uses a segment of code that he or she has not written, the source of the code segment must be cited using an inline comment in the program.
